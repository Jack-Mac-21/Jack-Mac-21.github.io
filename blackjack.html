                    Video games were one of the many things that inspired me to learn programming.
            I remember in Elementary school talking with my friends about creating a game company.
            Even if Blackjack was relatively simple compared to what I was used to playing, I was excited
            to make a game as one of my first programing projects. My partner Ben Caterine and me worked
            together to design and implment our version of blackjack using C++. I loved the gratification
            that came from seeing the game come together and that excitement drives me today.
